    <h1>My Favorite things</h1>
    <h2>Hobbies/interests</h2>
    <p>Football is one of my favourite hobbies because it keeps me active, competitive, and connected with others. Whether I’m playing on the field or watching a match, I love the excitement of the game, the teamwork, and the fast-paced action. It gives me a break from my daily routine while helping me build discipline and confidence.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy studying and gaming, which balance both productivity and fun in my life. Studying helps me stay focused on my goals and gives me the satisfaction of learning new things. Gaming, on the other hand, lets me relax, have fun, and explore different worlds and challenges. Together, these hobbies keep my mind sharp, motivated, and fully engaged.</p>
